Temporary file for instructions on compiling and running experiments 
with CPU and GPU symmetric heaps.

Compile:
--------
1. Export CUDA toolkit installation directory and add it to the system environment.
2. Run the following command to compile:

nvcc multi_sym_heap.cu -o multi_sym_heap -I<SOS install>/include -L<SOS install>/lib -lsma -lpmi_simple

Example Run:
------------
1. To allocate symmetric heap with cudaMallocHost:
SHMEM_DEV_SYMMETRIC_HEAP=-1 oshrun -n 4 ./multi_sym_heap
2. To allocate symmetric heap with cudaMallocManaged:
SHMEM_DEV_SYMMETRIC_HEAP=0 oshrun -n 4 ./multi_sym_heap
